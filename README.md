# Adjustable LCDs

## Introduction

This mod adds controls to LCDs allowing you to adjust position and rotation.


Rotors and subgrids are a pain right? I think we can all agree that needing a stack of subgrids, just for your cool bridge or sexy fighter cockpit, is 
both clangy and annoying (no projector subgrids anyone?). Well fear not brave engineer, for do I have the product for you. This ~~reasonably priced~~ mod will 
allow you to relocate your LCDs to your hearts content\*. 

\* Hitboxes do not change. I am not responible for any injury caused due to collisions with invisible blocks


## Features 

Adjust the location of any vanilla and possibly modded LCD. The full list of adjustable
properties is:

- Yaw
- Pitch
- Z offset
- Y offset
- X offset


### Disclaimer 

This mod changes the `LocalMatrix` of the block. This will likely confuse any mods or PB scripts which rely 
on the LCD always being aligned to an axis. I have yet to encounter a mod or PB broken by this but it may happen. 
You have been warned.
